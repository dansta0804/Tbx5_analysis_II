# Analysis of ChIP-seq target search using synteny blocks

The repository stores files that were used to perform analysis of
homology determination between house mouse and zebrafish. The
analysis was conducted in order to determine whether the search
of synteny blocks is a suitable approach for finding homologous
regions between genomes.

**Directory descriptions:**
- **Figures/** contains all the images that are generated by the R
script while performing analysis.
- **Intermediate_data_files/** stores sample key file and contains file
that stores synteny block positions between ***Mus musculus***
and ***Danio rerio*** organism genomes, and files that were created while
performing R analysis (the outputs of different dataframes).
- **Programs/** directory contains main R program files and Scikick reports.

Results of the analysis can be found [here](https://karklas.mif.vu.lt/~dast6577/KursinisProjektas/tbx5_analysis_II.html).
